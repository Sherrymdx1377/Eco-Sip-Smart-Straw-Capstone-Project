# Eco-Sip-Smart-Straw-Capstone-Project

Throughout this journey, I have gained a comprehensive understanding of key business concepts and developed a robust skill set that will enhance my career in data analytics and beyond. Hereâ€™s a snapshot of what Iâ€™ve learned:

ðŸ”¹ Marketing: Strategies and insights into consumer behavior, market segmentation, and crafting effective marketing plans. 

ðŸ”¹ Financial Accounting: Fundamentals of financial statements, balance sheets, income statements, and cash flow analysis. 

ðŸ”¹ Human and Social Capital Management: Techniques for managing teams, leadership skills, and optimizing organizational behavior. 

ðŸ”¹ Corporate Finance: Key principles of corporate finance, investment analysis, and valuation methods. 

ðŸ”¹ Operations Management: Processes and strategies for efficient operations, supply chain management, and quality control.

In the capstone project, I applied these principles to a real-world business challenge, developing a comprehensive go-to-market strategy, including a marketing plan, financial model, and production/service plan.
